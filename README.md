 Exciting Update: Completed a New Project! 
I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project, completed as part of a recent resume challenge. I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

The Challenge:
AtliQ Hotels, a chain of 5-star hotels across India, has been facing declining market share and revenue due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective management decisions. To counter this, they decided to adopt "Business and Data Intelligence" but lacked an internal Data Analytics team.

Their revenue management team brought in a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide key insights to help them regain their market position.

 Project Objective:
As a data analyst, my role was to work with sample data and a dashboard mockup, creating a dashboard that provides valuable insights to help AtliQ Hotels recover lost market share and revenue.

 Executive Overview:
This view presents an overall picture of our market share against competitors, highlights trends over time, breaks down revenue sources, and showcases key daily metrics used in the hospitality industry.

 KPI View:
Focused on critical metrics like Cancellation %, Revenue, Average Ratings trends, breakdown of successful bookings by room class, and key metrics for weekdays vs. weekends.

Key Takeaways:

Mastering DAX measures and calculated columns
Enhancing skills in Data Modeling
Applying impactful conditional formatting
Using Heatmaps to analyze total bookings by platform
Publishing and sharing insights via Power BI Service
